# 🌐 Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. It is transforming industries, improving user experiences, and unlocking new possibilities across sectors.

## 🤖 Core Fields of AI

- **Machine Learning (ML)**: Algorithms that allow systems to learn from data.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Enabling machines to understand and generate human language.
- **Computer Vision**: Interpreting visual data from the world, such as images and videos.
- **Robotics**: Designing intelligent machines capable of performing tasks in the physical world.
- **Expert Systems**: Rule-based systems designed to mimic decision-making of human experts.

## 📊 Popular AI Use Cases

| Use Case          | Description                          |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Virtual Assistants| Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant    |
| Fraud Detection   | Detecting unusual banking activity   |
| Recommendation Engines | Netflix, YouTube, Amazon         |
| Medical Diagnosis | AI-assisted analysis of X-rays and MRIs |

## 🔍 Did You Know?

> The term **"Artificial Intelligence"** was coined in 1956 by **John McCarthy** during the Dartmouth Conference.

## 🧠 Fun Fact

- AI doesn’t just mean Terminator-level robots—most AI today is *narrow AI*, focused on a single task.
- GPT-based models (like this one!) are part of **generative AI**, capable of creating text, images, and more.
